I could not open either of the two links provided in the PDF. However, I found an official tutorial on the Unity Learn platform called
"Create Your First Project", which I used instead.

<h2>Step 1: Check Unity Version</h2>

<p>
I already had some previous experience with Unity, so I skipped the step of downloading Unity Hub and the Unity Editor.
I already had both installed and also had a Unity account.

<h2>Step 2: Download and Create Essentials Pathway Project</h2>

<p>
I could not find the "Get Started With Unity" template mentioned in the tutorial. However, I found the "Essentials Pathway" template in the Learning section of Unity Hub, which provides similar beginner guidance and in-Editor tutorials. I selected this template and started downloading the required files to create the project.
