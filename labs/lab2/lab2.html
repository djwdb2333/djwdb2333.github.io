        I could not open either of the two links provided in the PDF. However, I found an official tutorial on the Unity Learn platform called
        "Create Your First Project", which I used instead.

        <h2>Step 1: Check Unity Version</h2>

        <p>
        I already had some previous experience with Unity, so I skipped the step of downloading Unity Hub and the Unity Editor.
        I already had both installed and also had a Unity account.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 2: Download and Create Essentials Pathway Project</h2>

        <p>
        I could not find the "Get Started With Unity" template mentioned in the tutorial. However, I found the "Essentials Pathway" template in the Learning section of Unity Hub, which provides similar beginner guidance and in-Editor tutorials. I selected this template and started downloading the required files to create the project.

        <h2>Step 3: Review the tutorial list and define the learning focus</h2>
        <p>
        I reviewed the course list and understood that it covers topics from the interface and 3D to audio, scripting, and 2D, and finally publishing the project. I chose to mainly focus on the audio section because I had not used spatial audio before.

        <h3>Step2: Add boiling_pot to the scene</h3>

        <h3>Step3: Add audio to the boiling_pot</h3>
        <p>I added an Audio Source component to the boiling_pot and used the bubbling sound as the audio source. I also enabled the loop option.</p>

        <h3>Step4: Change the Spatial Blend in the Audio Source</h3>
        <p>When I changed the Spatial Blend value to 1 and ran the scene, it felt like magic because I could hear the volume change depending on distance and direction.</p>

        <h3>Step5: Add background music for the scene</h3>
        <p>I added another Audio Source to the scene and selected background music for it.</p>

        <h3>Step6: Add random bird sounds outside</h3>
        The tutorial video couldn't be opened, so I followed the written instructions instead. First, I created an Audio Source and placed it outside the window. Then I selected a bird sound for it and changed it to spatial audio. Finally, I disabled Play On Awake to make sure it would not play continuously and added the “Play Sound at Random Intervals” component.

         <p class="problem"><b>Problem:</b> Then I tried to add more sound sources, but I found that even though I rotated them, the icons still looked the same. I am not sure whether I successfully changed the direction of the audio.</p>
