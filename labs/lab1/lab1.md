# Lab HW 1: Setup personal blog 

I used GitHub to set up my blog website.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

I created a repository on GitHub.

## Step 2: Setup README and Check Website

I wrote a README file and pushed it to the repository. Then I checked the website link. It could be opened, but it only showed my README file instead of a real homepage.

## Step 3: Create Homepage (Index File)

I created an index file and used it as my homepage. 
**Problem:**  
At the top of the page, it showed my GitHub account name. I found that this happened because I used a Markdown file instead of an HTML file. When using Markdown, GitHub Pages automatically displays the repository title.

## Step 4: Siwtch to html file

I watched a tutorial on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t=62s) to learn the basic structure of HTML and CSS. After finishing some exercises in the course, I started to switch my Markdown homepage file to an HTML file.

## Reflection

Finally, I successfully created my website, even though it does not look very good now.  
However, I am happy with it because this is my first time having my own website. If I have more time later, I would like to improve the design and decorate it.
