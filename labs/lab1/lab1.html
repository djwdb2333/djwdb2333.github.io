    <p>I used GitHub to set up my blog website.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository</h2>

    <p>I created a repository on GitHub.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Setup README and Check Website</h2>

    <p>
    I wrote a README file and pushed it to the repository. Then I checked the website link.
    It could be opened, but it only showed my README file instead of a real homepage.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3: Create Homepage (Index File)</h2>

    <p>I created an index file and used it as my homepage.</p>

    <p class="problem"><b>Problem:</b><br>
    At the top of the page, it showed my GitHub account name. I found that this happened
    because I used a Markdown file instead of an HTML file. When using Markdown, GitHub
    Pages automatically displays the repository title.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 4: Switch to HTML File</h2>

    <p>
    I watched a tutorial on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t=62s" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
    to learn the basic structure of HTML and CSS. After finishing some exercises in the course,
    I started to switch my Markdown homepage file to an HTML file.

    <div class="two-column">

    </div>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>

    <p>
    Finally, I successfully created my website, even though it does not look very good now.
    However, I am happy with it because this is my first time having my own website.
    If I have more time later, I would like to improve the design and decorate it.
